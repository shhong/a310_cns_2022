    "Construct a network model with the following specifications:\n",

    "1. The network has 100 cells,\n",
    "2. Each cell is a single compartment model with a diameter and length of 15 um,\n",
    "3. Each cell has the [Wang-Buzsáki mechanism](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/16/20/6402) inserted (`wb`),\n",
    "4. Each cell has one excitatory (tau1=0.25 ms and tau2=2 ms, e=0 mV) and inhibitory (tau1 = 1 ms, tau2 = 5 ms, e = -75 mV), based on the Exp2Syn mechanism.\n",
    "5. Each excitatory synapse is driven by an external stimulus generator, `NetStimFD`, that fires noisily (noise=1) at 50 Hz throughout the simulation. The synaptic conductance (weight of the connection) is 5 nS.\n",
    "6. Each inhibitory synapse is connected to other 50 random presynaptic cells in the network, with **a conduction delay (delay in the NetCon for the connection) of 4 ms** and synaptic conductance of 5 nS.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Plot the total spike count in time: make a histogram of all the spike times with 1 ms time bins and plot the result (see an example below. For making a histogram, see https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.histogram.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Find an oscillation frequency from the spike count time series. How does the oscillation frequency compare with the mean firing frequency? Hint: You can use the `welch` function in scipy.signal (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.welch.html) to compute a power spectral density. Make sure that your sampling rate (fs) is 1e3 since the time bin size is 1 ms. Note that `nperseg` controls smoothing (the smaller, the smoother) and `nfft` increases the number of the frequency points. Try to different `nperseg` and `nfft` to find good parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compute the mean spiking frequency per cell and compare this with the oscillation frequency found in 3. Are they the same? If not, why?\n"

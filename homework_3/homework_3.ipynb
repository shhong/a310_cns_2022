    "Here we ask you to reproduce Fig. 7.2B and 7.6Bin Rinzel and Ermentrout by using simulations of a single compartment model neuron with active mechanisms called the Connor-Stevens model (Connor JA and Stevens CF (1971) J Physiol. 213(1):31-53) (`conste`). In addition to the Hodgkin-Huxley-like Na+ and K+ channel, the Connor-Stevens model has another type of the K+ current called the A-type current. The conductance density of the A-current is initially `gabar_conste`=0.0477 S/cm2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Construct a single compartment neuron model with the following specifictations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A single section, named `soma`, with a diameter and length of 15 um,\n",
    "2. The Connor-Stevens mechanism inserted (`conste`),\n",
    "3. A current clamp (`h.IClamp`) electrode embedded.\n",
    "\n",
    "With simulation of this model, answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. While injecting the constant current with different amplitudes, count how many spikes the neuron fires. With the data, plot the relationship between the injected current vs firing rate relationship, the f-I curve as Fig. 7.2B and 7.6B. Please try to collect data densely around the rheobase (a current threshold for initiating repeatitive spiking) so that you can probe the shape of the f-I curve better around the rheobase. Which case do you think this correspond to, 7.2B or 7.6B? \n",
    "2. Turn off the A-current by setting the conductance `gabar_conste` to zero, and repeat the steps in 1. Again, which one is qualitatively similar to this case, 7.2B or 7.6B? \n",
    "3. In both cases, record the membrane voltage `v` and K+ channel gating variable `n_conste`, and draw the 2d phase plot, `v` versus `n_conste`. When the injected current crosses the rheobase, how does the phase plot change? And how does that change depend on the presence/absence of the A-current? Again, please make sure that the injected current is sufficiently close to the rheobase so that you can observe the near-threshold behavior."

Use phase space analysis as in Problem 1 to understand the model dynamics for firing patterns: For example, plot two dimensional plots of the somatic voltage versus dendritic voltage with different dendtrite sizes. Can you come up with a good explanation of the model neuron dynamics and its change by those plots? Try other variables for your phase space analysis."
